HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and JavaScript (vanilla)

- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -
This is a mini app with an algorithm implemented that checks if a given string is a palindrome or not.

The algorithm run in O(n) time complexity where n = given string length and O(1) space complexity which means constant space.

The program includes a one input form in HTML managed with vanilla JavaScript and a button to submit the form. 

- RELATED HTML TOPICS - 
1. hx tags for titles, subtitles, etc
2. p tags for paragraphing and introducing plain text content
3. div tag for boxing the ending result
4. input for collecting the user's choice

- RELATED CSS TOPICS - 
1. Reseting default values of padding, margin, etc applied on the body
2. Basic properties like color, margin, etc
3. Bootstrap classes for responsive design

- RELATED JAVASCRIPT TOPICS - 
1. Getting an HTML element from the document with getElementById()
2. Creating functions (the algorithm itself)
3. Accessing the DOM for manipulate, introduce and remove HTML tags and plain text as needed
4. Conditional logics with if/else statements for introduce an element in reference of the user choice
5. While loop for iterating through the given string length
6. Event listener for capturing clicks of the user and changes in the input
7. charAt() method for tracking the current compared letters of the string
